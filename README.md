# SVG Logo Maker

This SVG logo maker was created for freelance web developers to generate simple logos for projects without the need to pay a graphic designer.

## Description

This SVG logo maker was created as a challenge for bootcamp students to apply everything that was learned in module 10 of class. The challenge will make this logo maker run in the command line and will be invoked by using the node index.js command. This app functionality will be achived by using the inquirer package and jest for testing.

## Acceptance Criteria

    - Having a source code
    - Given a command-line application that accepts user input
    - When I am prompted for text I can enter up to three characters
    - When I am prompted for the text color I can enter a color
    - When I am prompted for a shape I am presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square.
    - When I am prompted for the shape's color I can enter a color
    - When I have entered input for all the prompts an SVG file is created named logo.svg and "Generated logo.svg" is logged in the command line
    - When I open the logo.svg file I am shown an image that matches the criteria I entered within a 300x200 pixel
